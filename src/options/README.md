Options

## Strategies

First, look for stocks at or near proper buy points. Most will be building bases. 
After that, look for a slightly out-of-the-money weekly or monthly call option. This means the strike price is just above the underlying
stock price.  Every strike price comes with a premium, or the cost of the option. 
Divide the premium by the stock price, and multiply by 100; this gives you the downside risk for the trade in percentage form. 
Look for trades with downside risk of 4% or less.
